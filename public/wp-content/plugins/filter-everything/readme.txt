[Filters](https://filtereverything.pro/resources/filters-widget/), [Sorting field](https://filtereverything.pro/resources/sorting-widget/) and [Chips](https://filtereverything.pro/resources/chips-widget/) (selected filters) can be inserted on a page as widgets or [shortcodes](https://filtereverything.pro/resources/shortcodes/)
This allows you easily to integrate filters on your site independently from a theme or page builder you use.

### Page builders
The plugin is compatible with almost all page builders. It was tested with Elementor, Divi, Themify, WPBakery Composer, Oxygen, Beaver builder, Bricks Builder, Breakdance etc.
As the Free version of the plugin supports filtering of the native WordPress loops (Main WP_Query) only, the full support of the page builders is provided in the PRO version.
